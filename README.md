# planner
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner, so that I can manage my time effectively.

## motivation
Our busy everyday schedules can be hard to keep up with. From meetings to appointments, it's easy to become overwhelmed and stressed by the daily grind. A planner that lets you save upcoming events and keeps track of them can help with maintaing organization and time management.

## framework
*	Javascript
*	jQuery
*	moment.js
*	html5
*	css

## feautures
* Updates the current time using moment.js
* sets the current hour block to red, past hours to blue, and future hours to green
* lets user input an event, saves it to localstorage, and displays it on the page even after refresh
* displays current date in the header
